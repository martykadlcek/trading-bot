[service]

# specifies an instance file
# the instance file is file created when service starts and it
# is used to communicate with the command-line interface.
# 
# this file also used to detect, whether the bot is running, to
# support start/stop/restart and other features. You can run multiple
# instances where the each instance has different inst_file.
#
# if you delete instance file while the bot is running, you will 
# unable to control the service. You need to kill it manually
# using killall (or pidof mmbot and kill)
#

inst_file=../run/inst.pid

# Allows to change effective user. This is useful, when the bot
# is started under root account. However it is not recommended at all.
# it is better to start the bot directly through the "su".

# user=mmbot

# socket file used to communicate with webserver

socket=../run/mmbot.socket:666

# enable listening on specified port. It is disabled by default to enable multiple instalations

#
# A specified value above 0 allows to use more threads for the both traders and web service. Traders
# are running in parallel (more traders at once) allowing smooth experience while accessing through the
# web]. It is worth to allow two or three threads for singlecore instance to minimize impact of internet lag
